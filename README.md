# GitHub Profile Search Project

This project contains a simple React application that allows you to search for GitHub users and view their profiles. The project includes examples of React components, prop usage, and communicating with the GitHub API through fetch.

## How It Works

1. In the project directory, open the terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   This command will install the project dependencies.

2. Next, start the project with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will launch the application in development mode, and you can view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. When the application is running in your browser, enter a GitHub username into the search bar and click the "Search" button.

4. The results will be displayed as cards with the username and profile picture. You can click on each card to navigate to the GitHub profile.
